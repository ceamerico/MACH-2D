Besides the first derivative that must be given for the domain, there are the following boundary condition options (opt):
0 = Given second (diff2YN) and third (diff3YN) derivatives on the east boundary
1 = Given second derivative on the east boundary (third derivative is calculated auto. considering the fourth derivative equals zero)
2 = Third and fourth derivatives are equal zero on the east boundary (second derivative is calculated automatically)
